## CIS406 - Java Programming 1

A collection of my coursework from Java Programming 1 at Strayer University. Originally here as a backup to ensure my work couldn't be lost due to local hardware issues or the like, but now it's nice to have a repository for the work I've done. I have an (often detrimental) tendency to go above and beyond on work that really doesn't need it. As a result, several of the projects here include code or methods that were not at all necessary to get the grade, but made me happier to design.

My favorite example of why I might need professional help is the Ultimate String Tabber method: takes in a column of n length and automatically tabs all entries to algin the horizontal space required by the column. When used on multiple columns, you get a very nicely aligned table you can output to the console (with a little double for loop pivoting, of course).

The project orderEntryPhase4 is the culmination of everything the class taught, as well as my neurotic tendencies. I try to comment on all of my code - within reason - so anyone who happens upon it in the future (such as myself) can have a better chance of understanding what in the world is going on.
